# Learning-Documentation
This repository holds documentation outlining my understandings of two key tools provided to us for INFR 2810. 
The format of each markdown file follows the format described for the "Class Work - July 10" assignment, as follows:
  1. Link title
  2. URL
  3. Summary of content
  4. Key takeaways
  5. Personal insights or reflections

Documentation has been completed for the following two learning tools:
[Learning Notes for CPU Visual Simulator](learning_notes.md)
[Learning Notes for Compiler Explorer](learning_notes1.md)
