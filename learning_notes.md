# Learning Notes for CPU Visual Simulator
**Link title:** CPU Visual Simulator  
**URL:** https://cpuvisualsimulator.github.io/

## Summary of website content 
#### Initial GUI, Simulation Experience
The initial website GUI provides a visual simulation of the basic components of a CPU and the RAM.

CPU components:
- Instruction Register
- Control Unit
- MUX
- Arithmetic Logic Unit
- Accumulator
RAM:
- Address in RAM
- Info stored at that address
Connectionsa between the CPU and RAM
- Data Bus
- Address Bus
- Control Bus
In addition to the simulatred CPU & RAM, the website provides a control panel at the bottom of the website which includes a control bar for the program, a box that allows you to toggle binary and simulation animatiions, and a text box which provides information on what the simulator is doing.

The website provides additional features to modify the simulation experience. Such as:
1. Manual
  - Details information regarding the history and purpose of this tool; a description for each of the instruction set terms that the CPU simulator supports;  keyboard shortcuts; a guide on how to write, load, and save files that this visualization supports; and examples of pseudocode and their associated simulation instruction set.
2. Examples
  - Allows the user to select from three pre-defined popular programming operations. Selecting any of these options will edit the simulation to run the selected operation.
3. Load
  - Allows the user to load a .cpuvs file to populate the simulator.
4. Save
 -  Allows the user to save the current view of the simulation as either a URL or a .cpuvs file.
5. Settings
  - Allows the user to change various high-level settings of the simulation (such as language and the ability to see explanatory text in the control panel text box); configure text to speech settings; change the color of the various elements in the simultor.
