# Learning Notes for A Survey of Computer Architecture Simulation Techniques and Tools
**Paper Title:** A Survey of Computer Architecture Simulation Techniques and Tools  
**Authors:** Ayaz Akram; Lina Sawalha  
**URL:** https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8718630  

**General Description:** This paper surveys and compares various popular computer simulators. The paper focuses more so on full-computer simulators that are primarily used in professional or academic research, as opposed to our previous simulators that focused mainly on the CPU and were comparatively elementary.  

## Article Summary
